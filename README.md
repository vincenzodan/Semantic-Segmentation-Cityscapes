# Semantic-Segmentation-Cityscapes
Implemented and trained deep learning models to perform pixel-level classification of urban scenes using the Cityscapes dataset. The project involved preprocessing high-resolution street-view images, designing a convolutional neural network architecture, and applying techniques such as data augmentation and transfer learning to improve accuracy.
